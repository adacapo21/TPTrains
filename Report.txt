Train spotting Documentation

1) Placement of the sensors

	 We put our sensors on all tracks around each intersection so that each train can choose the next path, depending on semaphores, before engaging on one of them.

	All sensors are placed at the same distance from intersections so that we can determine the maximum speed of trains (trains have a stop distance linked to their speed). Trains must be able to stop before the intersection from the time they passed over the sensor. We set the minimal distance of 3 units (With this distance trains can't be either on an intersection and on a sensor).

	There are 4 sensors near stations which allow trains to know when to stop. Its detector also respect the minimum distance of 3 units before the end of the track.
